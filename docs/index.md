title: Remote Coding from Coffee Shops - iPad Mini + Agentic Coding Setup
---

I wanted to code from coffee shops without lugging a laptop. So I built a mobile workstation: an iPad Mini that connects to my Mac Studio at home running AI coding agents. All the computing power stays home. I just carry the display, keyboard, and mouse.

This is my setup. There are many[^1] like[^2] it[^3], but this one is mine.

## The Shopping List

- **[Mac Studio](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FNS1ZX5B?tag=nathangathright-20)** - The always-on powerhouse at home running AI coding agents. Any Mac works, but desktop machines handle the "always available" role best.
- **[iPad Mini](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKL4DTYN?tag=nathangathright-20)** - Any recent model works. The smaller size makes it perfect for portability.
- **[TwelveSouth HoverBar Duo](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B6QD3NZV?tag=nathangathright-20)** - Adjustable iPad stand that works great for standing height ergonomics.
- **[Apple Magic Keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DL6LV7Q6?tag=nathangathright-20)** - Compact, Bluetooth, and has great key travel. The rechargeable battery lasts weeks.
- **[Logitech MX Master 4 Wireless Mouse](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FC5V3YVY?tag=nathangathright-20)** - Ergonomic, works on any surface, and pairs easily with iPad via Bluetooth.
- **[Cubilux Unidirectional USB-C Lavalier Microphone](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0963DLZCH?tag=nathangathright-20)** - Clips to your shirt, connects directly to iPad Mini via USB-C, and provides excellent isolation for noisy environments.

## Setup Guide

### Configure Your Mac

Run the setup script on your Mac (the one you want to access remotely):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nathangathright/tailscale-termius-tmux-setup/main/setup.sh | bash
```

This installs Tailscale and tmux, configures everything for remote access, and displays a QR code for easy iPad setup. It also adds powerful shell helpers:

- **[`sesh`](https://github.com/nathangathright/sesh)** - Tmux session manager for creating, attaching, and listing AI coding agent sessions
- **`unlock`** - Unlocks the macOS keychain (locked by default over SSH)

The script also installs a skill that teaches AI coding agents how to properly preview web projects over Tailscale for any framework.

Tailscale encrypts all traffic end-to-end and your Mac is only accessible to devices on your private network—no ports exposed to the internet.

If you prefer to set things up manually, see the [README](https://github.com/nathangathright/tailscale-termius-tmux-setup) for step-by-step instructions.

### Configure Your iPad

Install these apps from the App Store:
- [Tailscale](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tailscale/id1470499037) - Sign in with the same account you used on your Mac
- [Termius](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/termius-ssh-client/id549039908) - The SSH client you'll use to connect
- [Wispr Flow](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6497229487) - For voice input (optional)

Then scan the QR code displayed by the setup script from your iPad's camera. This opens Termius with your connection pre-filled.

If the QR code doesn't work, manually create a new host in Termius using the hostname and username shown by the script.

## Your Daily Workflow

Here's my typical coffee shop session:

1. **Arrive and set up** - Takes about 2 minutes to assemble everything
2. **Open Termius** and connect to Mac Studio via Tailscale
3. **Unlock the keychain** if you need git or code signing:
   ```bash
   unlock
   ```
4. **Start coding with `sesh`:**
   ```bash
   # Interactive wizard (name + project path)
   sesh new

   # Create/attach directly
   sesh myproject ~/code
   sesh -s work -p ~/app

   # Pick from existing sessions
   sesh list
   ```
5. **Code away** - Your chosen coding agent launches automatically in the tmux session you created/attached.
6. **Use voice input** - Tap to activate Wispr Flow and speak prompts to your coding agent
7. **Detach when leaving:**
   ```bash
   # Press Ctrl+B, then D to detach
   # Or just close Termius - tmux keeps running
   ```

Everything stays running at home, so you can pick up where you left off from any location. You can have multiple named sessions for different projects.

## Previewing Web Projects

Since your iPad and Mac are on the same Tailscale network, any dev server running on your Mac is already accessible from your iPad. Just visit `http://<tailscale-hostname>:<port>` in Safari. Make sure your dev server binds to `0.0.0.0` instead of `localhost` (most frameworks have a `--host` flag for this).

The setup script installs a skill that knows the correct preview commands for every major framework. Just ask your coding agent to "preview this project over Tailscale" and it will handle the rest!

**Manual reference**: See [CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/nathangathright/tailscale-termius-tmux-setup/blob/main/CLAUDE.md) for detailed framework-specific commands (Vite, Next.js, Cloudflare Workers, etc.) and troubleshooting tips.

Need to share a preview with someone outside your Tailscale network? Use [Tailscale Funnel](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel):

```bash
tailscale funnel 3000
```

This gives you a public `https://<hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net` URL — no ngrok, no extra accounts, no ephemeral URLs. It's already built into the Tailscale you have installed.
